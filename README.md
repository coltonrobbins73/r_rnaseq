# RNA-seq Analysis Toolkit

This repository hosts a comprehensive collection of RNA-seq analysis tools, originally forked from [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/), a popular platform for bioinformatics discussions and resources. 

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Quality control, adapter trimming, and quality filtering.
- **Alignment**: Tools for aligning RNA-seq reads to reference genomes.
- **Quantification**: Methods for estimating gene and transcript expression levels.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Tools for identifying differentially expressed genes and transcripts between conditions.
- **Visualization**: Utilities for creating plots and visual representations of RNA-seq data.
- **Functional Analysis**: Pathway and enrichment analysis tools to interpret the biological significance of RNA-seq results.

Each tool in this toolkit has been carefully selected and tested to ensure reliability and ease of use.

## Installation

Most tools in this toolkit can be installed via Conda or Docker, providing a straightforward setup process. Here are the general steps to get started:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rna-seq-toolkit.git

cd rna-seq-toolkit

# Installation instructions for individual tools are provided in their respective directories
```

Please refer to the README files within each tool's directory for specific installation and dependency information.

## Usage

Below is a general example of how to use the tools in this toolkit. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the individual README files for each tool.

```bash
# Example command for preprocessing RNA-seq data
./preprocessing_tool -i input.fastq -o output_directory
```

Replace `preprocessing_tool` with the specific tool you wish to use and adjust the input and output parameters accordingly.
